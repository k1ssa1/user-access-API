# 🚀 Welcome to the Microservices Architecture Project using FastAPI 🚀

This repository is dedicated to exploring the world of microservices and how they work together to provide users with a reliable application. Our goal is to discover the intricacies of communication between microservices and how to effectively manage them.

We'll be using FastAPI as our web framework, and diving into both SQL and NoSQL database management systems to gain a comprehensive understanding of data management in a microservices environment.

📊 As the project grows, we'll also be looking at different cloud service providers and how to effectively utilize them. This repository specifically focuses on user access (registration and sign in) but stay tuned as we continue to expand the capabilities of our microservices.

🛠️ This project is perfect for developers looking to gain experience in microservices, FastAPI, and database management. It is also well suited for developers who want to learn more about cloud services and how to integrate them into their projects.
